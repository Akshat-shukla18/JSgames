JavaScript Game Development Collection
Hi Students, This repository contains a collection of classic and modern games built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and related web technologies. Each game demonstrates different programming concepts, game mechanics, and user interface designs.

Skill Set Used
Core Technologies
HTML5: Structure and semantic markup for game interfaces
CSS3: Styling, animations, responsive design, and visual effects
JavaScript (ES6+): Game logic, event handling, DOM manipulation, and browser APIs
Advanced Features
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Used in missileGame for 3D-like graphics and vector-based rendering
Canvas API: 2D graphics rendering for snakeGame
Audio API: Sound effects and background music integration
Event Handling: Mouse, keyboard, and touch input management
Animation & Timing: RequestAnimationFrame, setTimeout, and CSS transitions
Game State Management: Pattern tracking, scoring systems, and level progression
Modular Code Organization: Separation of concerns with multiple JavaScript files
Development Practices
Object-Oriented Programming: Class-based game objects and inheritance
Functional Programming: Pure functions for game logic and utilities
Event-Driven Architecture: Responsive user interactions
